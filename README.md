# Misc_Skilling

Consists of Labview, Multisim, Matlab projects performed during skilling sessions.

LABVIEW
* LABVIEW - Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench
* It is a platform for visual programming from National Instruments.
* LabVIEW reduces the complexity of programming, so you can focus on our engineering problems. It enables us to immediately visualize results with a built-in, drag-and-drop UI.

Multisim software provides SPICE simulation, analysis, and printed circuit board (PCB) tools to help you quickly iterate through designs and improve prototype performance.

MATLAB is for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems and products. It allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms.
